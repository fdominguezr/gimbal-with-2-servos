This is a prof of concept for a simple gimbal stabilizer with a Micro:bit board and two servos.
It won't hold any heavy stuff like mobile phone, HD cameras, etc, but some simple camera small should be fine.

Take care of servos, better with metal gear ("MG").
4 x 1.5 V AA batteries or 5 x 1.2 V AA batteries (6 VDC) should be enough, but don't expect a very smooth work, as servos usually requiere quite enough current. Ni-Cd or Li-ion batteries is better.
